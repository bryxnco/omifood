- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JS for scripts
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### My process

All along the building of this project i used a desktop-first workflow approach keeping my focus on the use of HTML5 semantic markup and good practice of writting CSS rules to make and write clean and sustainable code.

I used a mainly class approach to each tag element used for style the component and try to give a reusable approach to the style used, in order to later if neccessary to, well, actually reuse those for other similar component or pages.

I came up with a type scale on both spacing and font size in order to keep consistency on workflow.

Also used some helper class to not over write come CSS class and actually come up with a cleaner code.

I also implemented media queries in order to make the whole website responsive on any screen size.
